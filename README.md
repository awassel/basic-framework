# Basic CSS Grid Framework

Basic is a CSS framework built on [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and utilizing [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/). It was developed by [Addam Wassel](http://www.addamwassel.com) while working at [Organic](http://www.organic.com).

## Requirements

First, the developer will need to have Ruby installed on their system to run these tools. We're running Ruby version 1.9.3 on our local machines. Anything under Ruby v2.0 should work properly. Ruby documentation can be found here: https://www.ruby-lang.org/

If they are on a Mac, great! It's preinstalled in Mac OSX.

If they are on a PC, they can download the RubyInstaller and grab the correct version of the source code here: http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

### [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

We're running Sass version 3.2.12 on our local machines. They can read about Sass and what it does at the website: http://sass-lang.com/

Once Ruby has been installed, run the following command to install Sass:

    gem install sass –v 3.2.12

### [Compass](http://compass-style.org/)

We're running Compass version 0.12.2 on our local machines. They can read about Compass and what it does at the website: http://compass-style.org/

Once Ruby has been installed, they can run the following command to install Compass:

    gem install compass –v 0.12.2

### [Breakpoint](http://breakpoint-sass.com/)

We're using a specific Ruby gem for our breakpoints. It's called Breakpoint (creative name, eh?). They can read the documentation here: http://breakpoint-sass.com/

Once Ruby has been installed, they can run the following command to install Breakpoint:

    gem install breakpoint –v 2.0.7
